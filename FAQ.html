				<p><b>Q: Do you only sell houses or single family homes?</b></p><br/>

       <h4>Frequently Asked Questions About Selling Property</h4>
 
				<p><b>Q. What if my house is already listed with an agent?</b></p><br/>
				
				<p>A. You can still sell your house to us, however, you may need to compensate your agent according to the terms of your agreement.</p><br/>
				
				<p><b>Q. Can I still sell my house if I'm in the process of evicting a tenant or have tenant troubles?</b></p><br/>
				
				<p>A. Yes. We can close escrow with the tenant occupying the property.</p><br/>
				
				<p><b>Q. Can I sell my house in probate?</b></p><br/>
				
				<p>A. Yes. We will make a valid offer subject to the completion of the probate.</p><br/>

				<p><b>Q. How long does it take to get an offer?</b></p><br/>
				
				<p>A. Although every situation is unique, it is not unusual to get an offer within 48 hours.</p><br/>
				
				<p><b>Q. Will you list my house?</b></p><br/>
				
				<p>A. If that is your best option we can help you to do that. However, if you want to sell your house fast and avoid commissions, in many cases we will just pay cash for your home. This eliminates all agent commissions, home inspections, appraisals, and bank loan approvals.</p><br/>

				<p><b>Q. What types of property do you buy?</b></p><br/>
				
				<p>A. We buy any type of property in any condition. This includes single family homes, multi-family homes, apartments, and commercial properties.</p><br/>
				
				<p><b>Q. What do you mean by a "cash offer?"</b></p><br/>
				
				<p>A. We use our own cash to buy your property, which eliminates the need for a loan or any approval from outside sources. We have the power to make decisions and close quickly.
