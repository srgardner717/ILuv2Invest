	  <p><big>Are you investing in Real Estate? What kind of a return did you get on your 401k last year?<br>So what is the big deal about investing in real estate? To answer that question we need to take a step back and look at our history as a place to start.</big></p>
	  <p><big>What is the one thing that all of the wealthy and nobles have in common? Real estate. It has been the place to invest since the beginning of mankinds time upon this earth. Nothing has changed when it comes to owning land over the millennia, real estate is where the wealthy still invest their money today.	  </big></p>
	  
	  	  	<img src="images/logo.jpeg" alt="Invest in Real Estate" style="float:right;width:362px;height:142px;padding:10px;">
	  
	  <p><big>But Why? Well it's pretty simple when you sit and think about it. For starters it is a great Tax shelter. Not only can you protect your hard earned money by reinvesting in real estate but being an investor opens the door to hundreds of tax breaks as well. That alone should be enough to make someone want to invest their spare change in properties. Secondly you will get a higher rate of return on your investment, or ROI as they call it.Think about this, your bank accounts might earn you 1% return and your cd's are getting 2-3% at best. With real estate you can get 10, 20, 50, 100% or more ROI. How does that strike you? That's the reason the wealthy invest and that's the reasons you should too. </big></p>

	  <p><big>So here is the best part, you can use your existing retirement funds to fund your real estate deals, or lend them to other investors. Would you rather let it sit in someone else's hand having them decide what's best for your money? I like having control over my money and where I put it. So why am I looking for private money lenders? Simple, I can always use more capital to invest. Partner up with me and watch your returns soar higher then they ever have before.</big></p>
